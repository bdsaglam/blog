    "HuggingFace Text Generation Inference server supports only text completion. However, we want to send chat messages with system, user, and assistant roles same as OpenAI models (i.e. `ChatML` format). Fortunately, [LiteLLM supports Llama-2 chat template](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/huggingface), which will convert chat messages to text prompt before calling TGI server. All we need to do is to specify `model` paramater as `huggingface/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b`. For models not supported by LiteLLM, we can create a custom template. \n",
